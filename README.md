# Owen Moogk
Hey, I'm Owen, a Mechatronics Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo (graduating in 2027)!

I enjoy solving interesting problems, usually with software and/or hardware. I'm passionate about robotic systems, space travel, motorsport, and energy solutions, and love to travel while working on advanced technology. I'm typically using tools like Altium, Python, React, SolidWorks, and 3D Printers to make cool stuff!

I'm an incoming software developer at [Base Power Company](https://www.basepowercompany.com) in Austin, TX, starting in January 2026.

I've formerly been employed at [Wrmth](https://wrmth.ca), [Rocket Factory Augsburg](https://rfa.space), [Qamp](https://www.linkedin.com/company/qampio), [QC Career School](https://www.qccareerschool.com/), the [ULethbridge Hub for Neuroengineering Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hub-for-neuroengineering-solutions), and [BusPlanner](https://busplanner.com) in engineering related roles.
