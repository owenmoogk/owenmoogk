# Owen Moogk
Hey, I'm Owen, a Mechatronics Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo (2027).

I enjoy solving interesting problems (usually with software and/or hardware). Using Altium, Python, React, 3D printing, and SolidWorks to make cool stuff!

I've formerly been employed at [Rocket Factory Augsburg](https://rfa.space), the [ULethbridge Hub for Neuroengineering Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hub-for-neuroengineering-solutions), and [BusPlanner](https://busplanner.com) in engineering related roles.
