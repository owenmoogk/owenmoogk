# Owen Moogk
Hey, I'm Owen, a Mechatronics Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo (graduating in 2027).

I enjoy solving interesting problems, usually with software and/or hardware. Using Altium, Python, React, 3D printing, and SolidWorks to make cool stuff!

I'm currently working at [Wrmth](https://wrmth.ca) in North Bay as an electrical engineering student, designing and building heated outdoor furniture!

I've formerly been employed at [Rocket Factory Augsburg](https://rfa.space), the [ULethbridge Hub for Neuroengineering Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hub-for-neuroengineering-solutions), and [BusPlanner](https://busplanner.com) in engineering related roles.

For more information about my work, see my [website](https://owenmoogk.github.io) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/owenmoogk/).
